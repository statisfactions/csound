Title: Accessing Csound functionality through R
Version: 0.1-0

Author: Ethan Brown
Maintainer: Ethan Brown <ethancbrown+playitbyr@gmail.com>
Depends:
    R (>= 2.12.0),
    rdyncall
Description: Provides some basic access in an R session to
    Csound (http://www.csounds.com), a powerful free and
    open-source software synthesizer. The package
    functionality is largely geared towards supporting the
    needs of the playitbyr package and is not particularly
    mature on its own, but it certainly can be used without
    knowing anything about playitbyr.
SystemRequirements: A valid copy of the Csound library must
    present. Csound can be downloaded from
    http://www.csounds.com. The library is included in the
    Windows and Mac OS X binaries; binary Linux
    distributions often package the library separately from
    the executible file, so for instance on Debian and
    Ubuntu you would need the "libcsound64-dev" package.

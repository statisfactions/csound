    rdyncall
Description: Provides some basic access in an R session to
    Csound (http://www.csounds.com), a powerful free and
    open-source software synthesizer. The package
    functionality is largely geared towards supporting the
    needs of the playitbyr package and is not particularly
    mature on its own, but it certainly can be used without
    knowing anything about playitbyr.
